# Personal Log Manager

REST API for personal logs

## Requirements

- .NET SDK/runtime targeting `net10.0`

## Development

### Build

```bash
dotnet build
```

### Run

```bash
dotnet run
```

### Release

The repository includes `release.sh`, which delegates to the upstream deployment script used by the project maintainer.

```bash
bash ./release.sh 1.0.0
```

This script downloads and executes an external release helper from: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hmlendea/deployment-scripts/master/release/dotnet/10.0.sh`

**Note:** Piping into `bash` is an intensely controversial topic. Please review any external scripts before running them in your environment!
